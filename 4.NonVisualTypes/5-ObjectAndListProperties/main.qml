        . Exploring object and list properties
            . Taking reference from the example :
                https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-referenceexamples-properties-example.html
            . The difference from the Qt 5 course is that they changed the
                parameter types form functions taking a size from int to qsizetype

                    . In Qt 6 they take qsizetype :
                        .     static qsizetype playerCount(QQmlListProperty<Player>*);
                                static Player* player(QQmlListProperty<Player>*, qsizetype);

                    . While they took int in Qt 5 :
                        .    static int playerCount(QQmlListProperty<Player>*);
                                static Player* player(QQmlListProperty<Player>*, int);

            . The rest is the same as in Qt 5

            . Take explanations from the docs :
                https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-cppintegration-exposecppattributes.html#properties-with-object-types

            . This explanation must not be left out :
                Properties with Object-List Types
                    Properties containing lists of QObject-derived types can also be exposed to QML.
                    For this purpose, however, one should use QQmlListProperty rather than QList<T>
                    as the property type. This is because QList is not a QObject-derived type,
                    and so cannot provide the necessary QML property characteristics through
                    the Qt meta object system, such as signal notifications when a list is modified.

            . Combine it with the Qt 5 course material
